## Adaptational Vortex
The adaptation Vortex works slightly differently from the normal Tesla Vortex. A Tesla Vortex operates never touching 3, 6, or 9 and rotating between 1, 2, 4, 8, 7, and 5.

Lets define R as the robot, drone, or machine learning algorithm.

~~~
      8               1 R
      +               +
     / \             / \
    /   \           /   \
   /     \         /     \
7 +       \       /       + 2
   \       \     /       /
    \       \   /       /
     \       \ /       /
      \       X       /
       \     / \     /
        \   /   \   /
         \ /     \ /
          +       +
          7       4

In the adaptational version, nine different permutations of the old rulesets is created, and then the principles of the Vortex is applied. So each time the starting point is different by not chosen by chance.

~~~
      8               1 R1
      +               +
     / \             / \
    /   \           /   \
   /     \         /     \
7 +       \       /       + 2 R2
   \       \     /       /
    \       \   /       /
     \       \ /       /
      \       X       /
       \     / \     /
        \   /   \   /
         \ /     \ /
          +       +
          7       4

In this way, if you were to create 9 possible drones. Each drone would start at a different point and never be in the same location at once.

Note that this is still in testing and may not work like I'm expecting.
